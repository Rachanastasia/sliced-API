QUESTIONS
    Should ingredients and instructions be stored in the same table with a key to
    differentiate, or should they be different tables, both with a 1:1 relationship
    to the user_recipes table???

    Should I convert everything into standard (not american) units to make the 
    calculations easier -- then convert back? 

    Putting seed files in .env?

    NUMERIC DECIMAL for decimal and whole number?
