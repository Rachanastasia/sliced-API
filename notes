QUESTIONS
    How do I store the data in the database so that it can be retrieved by user?
    Or is that done a different way?

    Should ingredients and instructions be stored in the same table with a key to
    differentiate, or should they be different tables, both with a 1:1 relationship
    to the user_recipes table???

    Should I convert everything into standard (not american) units to make the 
    calculations easier -- then convert back? 

    Putting seed files in .env?

    NUMERIC vs DECIMAL for decimal and whole number?




MEASUREMENTS
1 tsp = 5 mL
1 tablespoon = 15 mL
1/4 c (or 2 floz) = 60 mL
1/3 c = 80 mL
1 c = 250 mL



NOTES
    I want to be able to route to the ingredients based on 
    how it was established by the recipes-router
    i.e. /api/recipes/:id/ingredients
    rather than api/ingredients
